  headline: Dr. Klaus Ackermann
  content: 'Klaus is Lecturer at the Department of Econometrics and Business Statistics
    at Monash University. His passion is in technology, economics, data and computational
    approaches to get exciting insights about human behaviour. Broadly speaking, his
    research sits under the headline: how does technological progress affect societies
    and vice versa? What behavioural patterns that were disguised previously can now
    be researched as people reveal their choices through the use of technology? How
    can we use collected data to improve operational outcomes of not for profit organizations
    by using Machine Learning? There are social issues that need to be addressed on
    an individual level, but he believes it is possible to impact the world on an
    aggregate level by using data.<br><br>Website: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/acck1aus/"
